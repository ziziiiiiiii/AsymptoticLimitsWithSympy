This project was made for CECS 328 at CSULB. It is written in Python. It takes input from the user in the form of asymptotic functions. The limit of these functions is found. Using the asymptotic symbol provided, the user is then returned an output of whether the relationship between the equations input is true.

Example inputs are provided in comments at the end of the program. The user can copy from these are use them as a baseline to write their own.
